# MNIST Fashion Classifier Using TensorFlow.js - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## Description

This project demonstrates the use of TensorFlow.js to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying fashion items from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The project showcases how machine learning can be implemented directly in the browser.

The application allows users to view the classification process in real-time, including the input image, the predicted category, and the confidence level of the model.

## Features

- Real-time classification of Fashion MNIST dataset images.
- Visualization of input images and prediction results.
- Interactive interface to control the classification speed.
- Detailed console logs for monitoring training progress.
